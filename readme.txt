Simple widgetized display of the latest posts in your custom post type. Also allows for easy filtered display of regular posts in a widget.

== Description ==
= Simplicity at its finest! =
This simple plugin adds a widget that allows for the display of recent posts in any custom post type. It functions almost identically to the built-in WordPress "Recent Posts" widget with the added option of letting you choose which post type it pulls from. Just add the "Latest Custom Post Type" widget to a widget area, give it a title, how many posts to show and what post type you want it to pull from. It's that easy!

= Advanced Options =
While this plugin allows for quick and easy use, there are also LOADS of advanced features that site owners, designers, and developers will all enjoy.

* Change how the posts are pulled (e.g. Publish date, modified date, meta keys)
* Change how they are displayed (e.g. Pull by modified date, but show in alphabetical order)
* Define custom text for when there are no posts to show (defaults to showing nothing)
* Define custom CSS classes
* Show post thumbnails with the option of a default thumbnail image and custom size
* Show the post date/time or post modified date/time and specify the format
* Show post excerpts, specifying the length and read more link text
* Restrict posts by taxonomy and taxonomy terms

= A word on support and additional features =
Due to time constraints, I am not able to keep up with this plugin as much as I would like. If you want to help keep it up do date, feel free to create a pull request on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dfwood90/latest-cutom-post-type-updates)!

== Installation ==
1. Copy the entire "latest-custom-post-type-updates" folder into your wp-content/plugins folder.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Add the widget to a widget area and select your options.
4. Get the latest custom post type updates on any page!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can you add 'some feature' to the plugin? =
I will only add features to the plugin that I deem as beneficial to my original purpose of the plugin and are general enough that they can be used by others in various situations. Also, due to time constraints, I may not have the time to add the feature myself. If you know how to code, feel free to create a pull request on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dfwood90/latest-cutom-post-type-updates) and I will review it and merge it in if I see it as beneficial. Please follow [WordPress coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) when formatting code!
